# AP Computer Science A Notes

This repository contains copies of the notes and activities used in John Guzauckas' AP Computer Science A class at Windsor High School in the school year 2023-24.

The goal of this collection is to give students a single place to go to find resources from class instead of navigating through the many individual repositories.

## TODO

- Test overall structure with submodules of the first couple classes of notes
